<1,1>	Bought my first pair of 7 For All Mankind jeans and I loved them so much I went right back to the store to get another pair! I wanted to make sure I had the same amazing fit so I tried on another pair of The Skinny jeans with Slim Illusion. My first pair were a 27 and these ones seemed a bit baggy so I went down to a 26. They seemed okay but after a full days wear they are baggy, too! Seems weird to me that I would need two totally different sizes in the same type of jeans! Now I can't return them because I bought them on a trip and can't get back to the store. What gives, 7 For All Mankind??

<1,1>	Just bought, a pair of your Slim Illusion Luxe High Waist Ankle Skinny in Dark Legacy. Got so tired of all the poor quality jeans, that were either too tight, stiff, or too long on my 5ft frame. Wanted to find best quality denim jeans. Every article I read mentioned, your brand. I was lucky, went downtown on subway to Greenwich Village Monday. Saw your store, on West Broadway, so went in to look. Noticed 40% off, everything in store, so asked the sales associate if she had high waisted skinny jeans for my height. I tried them on, couldn't believe, how comfortable, and they contoured to all the curves of my legs. Best looking jeans I've ever worn, so happy to get them on sale. I had the girl cut of the tags, so I could wear them home. They are more like regular length on me rather than ankle cause of my height. I'm hoping they can get the gray ones in my size, so I can try them on, and buy them. I'm also, so glad they are made in the USA.

<1,0>	She hugs you like no one else does. Well...your Levi's come a close second. Happy #MothersDay! 
<1,0>	Since its invention in 1873, the 501¬Æ jean has taken on a life of its own as a beloved icon of culture and style around the world. Watch as it progresses through history, evolving with the world around it. Today, we celebrate the #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
<1,0>	The oldest pair of Levi‚Äôs in existence date back to 1879. It‚Äôs kept in a fire-proof safe in the Levi‚Äôs archives, to which only two people know the combination. At the time, we said the pants were : ‚Äòfor men who toil‚Äô, who wore them out, patched them up, passed them on‚Ä¶ They were, and still are, built to last. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
<1,0>	By the early 1950s, denim went from work clothes to work & play clothes. Women started wearing jeans to make a style statement. A trend that has stood the test of time. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
<1,0>	In 1934, the first blue jeans for women, Lady Levi‚Äôs, was created. A powerful message of equality‚Ä¶and a prolific fashion statement. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
<1,0>	The swinging 60s was an era in which jeans were an expression of individuality and freedom. Levi‚Äôs began selling bell-bottoms on March 11, 1969 ‚Äî just in time for Woodstock. A connection with music that lasted. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
<1,0>	In 1886, the Two Horse ¬Æ patch was first used to demonstrate the strength of the pants and reinforce our status as the originator of riveted jeans. A letter from 1938 recounts the adventures of Californian Elton Schram, who towed his neighbour‚Äôs car with a pair of Levi‚Äôs. A testament to strength, pulled off in style. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
<1,0>	Levi Strauss opened its first San Francisco factory to manufacture denim pants. The original design, called ‚ÄòXX‚Äô, was eventually assigned lot number 501. Just like that, an icon was born. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
<1,0>	In 1853, Levi Strauss arrived in San Francisco, carrying with him durable denim work pants for sale. Two decades later, a method to rivet the pants‚Äô pocket corners to make them stronger was invented. This changed the way the world dressed forever. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN #501Day

<1,0>	We can‚Äôt wait to see Katy Perry in the2015 holiday campaign! Till then, her red carpet looks 
<1,-1>	Dear H & M I would like to draw your attention to the kind of service (or rather lack threof) I received at your store on the Istiklal street in Istanbul which I visited on 24.07.2015 (evening) while I was on a vacation there. I visited the said store with a friend. I picked up a pair of boxers which were on sale and were now for 10 Turkish Liras, while my friend picked up a pair of sunglasses and a similar pair of boxers. While waiting in the line we thought we would get the billing done separately so we lined up at the cash counter with my friend ahead of me. Once my friend got his billing done and I approached the counter to get my billing done, a man (a local) came and barged into the line and spoke to the girl at the cash counter in their local language(possibly Turkish). They both exchanged a giggle and the man conveniently handed his stuff to the girl at the counter to get his billing done. When I object to this, the girl across the counter, whilst ignoring my objection, kept billing his goods. In spite of being irritated by such behaviour, I decided to not say anything further and simply get my billing done. After getting the billing done, when me and my friend were leaving the store we were behind the same local man. When we reached the store exit, the said local man exited while the sirens started ringing when we came near the door. Embarrassingly, we checked our packets. Upon checking, we found that the girl at the counter had not removed the electric tags from the merchandise we had bought. I volunteered to go back and get them removed while my friend waited outside. Now, as I went back and requested the girl to remove the tags she ignored my request and kept billing. By now I was quite annoyed and I believe the other girl (cashier) at the counter saw that and told the first one to attend to me after which she finally did remove the tags. However, as soon as I came out and checked with my friend, I realised that the product I bought was supposed to be on sale and the cashier had billed it for 25 liras (actual price ) instead of 10 liras (sale price) . I had paid 50 Liras and I was supposed to get back 40 Liras as the boxers were on sale whereas i only got back 25 Liras. Visibly annoyed, I went back to the counter and requested the girl to give me the actual balance. To my utter disgust she again ignored my request and kept at whatever she was doing whilst other customers watch on. The second cashier girl, upon noticing the ignorant attitude being meted out to me by the first cashier called me at her counter and finally gave me my balance back. I have a copy of the said bill/receipt with me. As a regular H & M customer, I have been to your stores in Dubai, London and USA. However, I have not received such racially discriminating and annoying treatment anywhere. I do hope that you look into this seriously and take the said person to task to avoid tarnishing your image.

<1,-1>	I just ordered a shirt from you and paid for express shipping only to be told it was back ordered a day after it was supposed to have shipped. And you know how you get really excited about an outfit for a date and then extremely sad when you can't where it when you want to? Especially when you've expedited shoes to match? Really hope there's some sort of refund system in place re: express shipping payment. Sincerely, Deflated customer. :-(

<1,-1>	VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER: I placed an order with you on the 26th of June paid in full and extra for express post shipping. I recieved a confirmation that it had been shipped however it never arrived, when i contacted Free people in relation to this I was told my my order was lost in transit and my express postage would be refunded (which it has not). I was then told that my order will be re shipped in 1-2 days. It took me to contact you, it would have been good practice to let me know what had happened. As the garments i had ordered were for an extremely important photo shoot my own business was conducting, leaving me to have to rechedule dates. Then I receieve this email from you......... this email is in reference to your recent order. Unfortunately, we were unable to process your order, as we could not obtain an authorization from your credit card company. You may wish to contact the issuing bank of your credit card regarding this matter, and then inform us of any additional information. We will hold your order for 48 hours, before it will be cancelled. Please respond quickly; merchandise cannot be held for your order and may become unavailable. For fastest results, please call us at the customer service number available on our website. Monday through Friday, 8 am to 8 pm, EST and a representative will be happy to assist you with this order. ????????? Why would you be trying to charge my credit car again, when my order was already paid for? Then tell me i should contact my bank ( Which i knew i did not need to ) AND then say you will hold my order for 48 hours before cancelling it????? WELL HOW KIND OF YOU TO HOLD AN ORDER I PAID IN FULL FOR! I responded to your email straight away after checking my bank receipts to find out i was infact charged the amount of $1,400 AUD and aking why you would be trying to take more money from me?? NO ONE has responded to any of my emails, I have now sent 5 in total asking for someone to contact me to tell me what is happening? After recieving no form of communication and living in Australia makes the time difference difficult for me to call, I actually got up ridiculously early today so that i could reach you. When i spoke to your representitive, she did not empathise with me in anyway and simply told me it had not been shipped as i owed 4 cents??????? Are you kidding I owe you 4 cents?? so you were holding my $1,400 order???? and not bothering to contact me in regards to this. When i purchase through a website it tells me how much i have to pay and it also takes the payment automatically from my card???? In actual fact my order was only $1,037.38 yet you took $1,400? but want another 4 cents? Your sales representative told me there was a glitch in your website and does this, so she credited the standard postage so the order could be sent out, however i paid EXPRESS post shipping, which she could no longer see due to the other sales person removing it in an earlier email? CONFUSED? ME TOO! I still do not know if my order has even been sent. and the person i spoke to was not even slightly compassionate over the phone. I am baffled at the lack of care and communications with your customers and let me tell you what a shame that is as i would have been a returning customer time and time again. I now will NOT be. I also wander how many other people this has happened too. Terrible service! If someone could bother to verify if my order has now been shipped that would be great, not holding my breath for a reply.

<1,-1>	I wear only Levi's denims... So I decided to gift myself Levi's this Diwali. We purchased clothing worth 8K plus from Levi's, Viviana mall... I totally forgot about my Levi's Loop card and cashier at the store never bothered asking for it. When I went for some alteration work after 2 weeks I suddenly remembered that I have a Levi's Loop membership. I requested the store manager to add my 8K purchase points to my loop card and he said it cannot be done now as billing system is online... That was the dumbest excuse given by someone. Guys at Hypercity also add points later if you don't carry the card and don't recollect your membership number. Is only customer responsible to get these points added? There is no responsibility on cashier's part? On top of that they simply forgot to alter my jeans. When I went to collect it, they gave reasons like machine wasn't working etc. They had my number but did not bother informing me about it. Didn't expect such a thing from Levi's... Totally disappointed...

<1,1>	Hey peeps! Hope you liked my 1st look of ‚ÄúThe Denim Story‚Äù. The denim shirt is such a versatile garment that it can be worn with almost anything. My 2nd look is very easy to style. Here, I‚Äôve paired my denim shirt with these super cool ripped brown shorts. I‚Äôve teamed this look with the most amazing tan mid-calf gladiator sandals which are super trendy. I‚Äôve been eyeing these beauties since ages and I finally found them at an E-commerce site on Instagram called Stylist Womaniya. They have some really good collection at very affordable price. These gladiators call for being the whole point of attention of your outfit, so don‚Äôt overdo the clothing and accessories and just focus on the sandals. I‚Äôve accessorized this look with a tassel sling bag and orange reflectors. This look is definitely one of my pics for a get away on the beach! What do you think? Would love to hear your views. :) Denim shirt : Newlook for koovs Brown ripped shorts : Forever 21 Tan gladiator sandals : Stylist Womaniya (you can find them on instagram) Tassel sling bag: Missbennett London for Jabong Orange reflectors: Moh√© Photo credits : Kanisha Modi - Clicker & Filmmaker For more, checkout my blog

<1,-1>	A very bad experience which i had on Sunday.!! Even after showing the mail which said skip the line..i and my friend had to stand in the line for a very long time!! If you guys are assuring it in the national newspaper..its very surprising you didn't execute it at all.. It was just a way to fool your customers.!! Totally disgusted by this!! And the ladies who screamed and yelled at the entrance were given entry within no time... It might not matter to you guys...but wasted a lot of time because of you guys..!! #NeverGonnaVisitForever21Again #NoCustomerValue #FeelingDisgusted 
<1,-1>	Hats off to your commitment for the flash sale which happened on 16th Aug that's yesterday. You put it on public newspaper that mail us and "skip the line", well to my surprise and I showed the mail which I received from your end I was asked to stand in line along with my friends even after having that mail which clearly stated that I can enter the store without standing in the Q. If you cant commit than better don't give falls hope. I traveled to this store for 1.5hrs being a loyal customer of Forever21 I didn't wanted to miss this sale, still after that entire travel, I made a point I will stand in line and then enter even after having "skip the line" pass. While I was entering the store when my turn came. I saw a lady shouting on top of her voice, she wanted to enter the store as she had the same mail and 2 minutes later I see her inside the store, and people over there including me stood in line for hours to enter the dam store, SHOCKING!. If you people want us to behave in the same manner than put it on paper "scream on us and we let you enter", you really want people to behave in such a manner and then let them enter Sick!. Don't know if losing one customer would hardly make a difference to you. But surely wont be coming back to this brand ever after such behavior. I regret to waste my entire day on you.

<1,-1>	Hi. I had placed an order # 20087053. Two items were defected and hence I returned them. Its been more than a month but neither I have got my money back and nor the fresh items. My email to customer care also went unanswered and so did the call. No one picks up your customer care toll free number. Is this how your customer service functions? You were quick to deliver but why do you take so long to refund my money? Please look into it asap.

<1,-1>	I have been buying from Forever 21 for quiet some time, but the recent customer service has been very, very disappointing! After cancelling my order no. 2009118, which was paid for, I haven't yet recieved my refund! IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN TWO WEEKS. This is thoroughly disappointing. Also disappointing is the customer service, the most recent one hung up on me when I told her my problem. This is not expected of Forever 21. Kindly return my money.

<1,-1>	So i ordered these pants from Forever21.in on the 14th of October and i still did not receive my order. I mean everytime i get a message saying "your order will arrive today keep the amount ready" but it doesn't. It's been more than a week that i placed my order. I received my order from all the other online websites in just 3-4 days. When i try and call the customer care number no1 picks up the call. The worst online portal ever. Never ever shopping online from forever21 again. 
<1,-1>	It's been 14 days since I placed my order on your website. Your courier tracking website does not work. I did not get a response to my query on your website. I have been calling your toll free number only to be spoken to very rudely by your extremely unhelpful staff, who seem to think they are doing me a favour helping me find a product I have paid for in full. Now I have been having my calls cut off for the last two hours, and you have been ignoring my every effort to contact you. Please revert on the status of my order at the earliest. Extremely dissatisfied with your service.

I've already made 4 calls on this, all I've got so far is a request to call back in 48 hours....over a period of 2 weeks!!

<1,1>	I thought that everyone wants to be forever 21 the best youth days 
<1,-1>	This is highly disgusting and stupid. the courier guy is asking me to come on road and collect my shipment. I don't understand why can't he deliver it to my office. In the past there has been courier delivery from Forever21 and they have delivered my courier inside the office. This is a serious issue as it is related to my safely and security. A random person calls me and tells me to collect the order on the road. On top of that your stupid staff is telling me maybe he is in a van maybe he is in a hurry may be this maybe that. I want to know why there is a call centre when they are not ready to help. The call centre girls name is Sarita and Ashima, they refused to give me the employee code i am not sure if the Employee name is correct or fake. I need a clarification on this.

When I called customer care, the lady didn't even ask for my order number and said there are some logistical issues and cut the call. When I called back today, another lady who sounded extremely upset with life told me that it would take another 5- 10 days because there are some items that are out of stock. I have already paid for these items and then she said my money will be returned in another 5- 10 days. There has been no email informing me that the items are out of stock nor has there been any call from forever 21 telling me that my order has been delayed which is completely unacceptable. I used to shop with them quite often but never again. TERRIBLE CUSTOMERCARE AND BAD LOGISTICS

Second of all, it's over 10 working days you douchebags. I want my money you utter dumb freaks. Unfreaking believable I paid for the crap first, then I had to return it, now I seeminglessly struggle to get my money back. Are you guys insane or what! Don't you think people have got other work to do rather than constantly poking you bunch of idiots to get their money back. Listen you , enough of this crap ! It's been over a freaking month now.

I had a real bad experience ordering online from Forever 21. You guys take a month to refund the money to your customers in the era where it takes 3 days max. It's like the guy hadn't got any other work to do apart from explaining the problem to your too-bad-to-be-true Customer Support and then getting a crappy reason for not being addressed. Is this my responsibility to ask 'You' guys if you got the Product back so that I could get 'My' money back. It's like Forever 21 is that witty friend who owes you money and you gotta constantly poke him, stalk him, shout on him, or sue him to get the money back. What sort of Company do you think you are !! Is this the way you address your Customers who by chance are the sole reason you make that Billions of revenue which by chance again happens to be the existence of this company. I want my money back ASAP and this is gonna be my last interaction ever with Forever 21. And a piece of advice- if you really like really really wanna remain in the market do revive your customer support as there are other players stepping in India with a much better plan for everything Cough cough ahem ....H&M ....cough.

<1,-1>	If you're looking to shop at a forever 21 online sale here's why you should not: 1) Cause the site will work so slowly on the day of the sale. It took me nearly 3 hours to place an order successfully. 2) After successfully placing the order, they will not even intimate you and cancel the order. So the the time put in goes down the drain. Brilliant service Forever 21.

<1,1>	The lovely ladies at Fashion Anthem have put together a little something in anticipation of tomorrow's store relaunch at DLF Promenade! 
<1,-1>	Addressed to Forever 21 India. Such disappointing service. I placed an order over 10 days ago. I placed 2 more orders consecutively. Having not received the first order in about 5-6 days, I called the customer service, which said that there was some trouble with their shipping service and that I will get it in another 2 days. Of course that did not happen, today when I called, the customer executive told me "Please consider your order cancelled" . REALLY? No mails. Nothing. I had to call them, and they say consider your order cancelled? I am guessing the other 2 orders will not be getting delivered either, now their customer service number will also just not connect.

<1,-1>	fraud### fraud### fraud### there was a 50% off on 30th of sep 2015 which i have ordered and my friends too, all the orders got cancelled and it's says items are not in stock. howz that possible? all the items that you have displayed on 30th of sep 2015 are all out of stock if you cannot give such sales then why you keep such offers. 
<1,1>	We're loving these camping essentials for the fashion-forward. 
<1,-1>	This is about the online sale on Forever 21. I am from Hyderabad, India I purchased a lot of items during the sale and got 2 defective dresses. I thought its okay, its forever 21 they will soon place a reverse pick up and refund me the amount and didn't bother much. I called to place a return request on 29th September'2015. they asked me to send a mail with images of defective items. I did so. After that my wait begun. For 5-7 days there was no reply or mail from them. During this time i called them several times nobody picks up. i mailed them twice nobody replied. On Oct 7th finally one of their executive picked up and apologized and said reverse pick up will be done within this week. Again I waited. No reverse pick up, no replies of mail, no one received call for another 7 days. On 14th Oct I finally got so frustrated that had they not picked up my call yesterday this post would have come yesterday. One of the executives picked up, apologized said I will replace return request and bla bla.. Today on 15th Oct I received a call for reverse pick up. Finally!! But in vain. Courier boy arrived and in his sheet there are wrong entries for reverse pick up. i try calling Forever people but no one picks up. So he had 2 entries one with 1 defective item and other with 2 items name and quantity given as 3. I had placed request for only 2 items. Now ofcourse the courier boy refused to take the other item since in his sheet it is marked as 3 items. So I am back to level 1 with again wait for my another defective item to be returned. Super frustrated! Never expected this kind of service with such a big and good store! I have no idea when my call will be received and 2nd item will be taken for return. :/ :/ 
<1,-1>	This is regarding my order number 20092013. I had placed an order for 8 items more than a week ago. But I did not get even a single mail confirming the order. The status still says NEW which means the order has not been dispatched yet. I can't track the order as well. Tried calling your customer care, wrote mails twice and did not get any reply. This is extremely unprofessional. I can't and don't intend to wait for the order anymore. Either you send it so that I can return it right away or cancel my order right away and give back the money which I had paid for the order as soon as possible. Hope atleast this message would be replied to.

Your Courier partner GoJavas has taken an item as reverse pickup from me & not delivered it to you guys.
