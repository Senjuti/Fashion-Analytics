<1,-1>	Zara is one of my favorite stores. However, my first time experience of ordering online has not been good. In the latter part of June this year, I ordered a few items online. July 1st, I receive an email from Zara's customer service informing me that there was a problem with the shipment of my order and because of that they would waive the shipping costs. July 7 I email them back because I still had not received my order. They wrote me back saying that my order was in fact delivered on June 30. How can it be delivered on June 30 when I received an email on July 1st about a problem with the delivery. Does not add up. So I called up customer service today and was told that it was indeed delivered on June 30. I said I did not receive the package and was there anything they can do for me. The customer service agent offered to give me the tracking number and said I should call Fedex and bring the issue to them. I said is that the only thing you can help me with? I said if I bring this up with Fedex they will just insist that the package has been delivered and their responsibility has been met. This incident is really disappointing. I will not order online anymore. It is very frustrating.

<1,-1>	VERY UNHAPPY!! :-( the worst service ever! I paced a order over a week ago FA10076675, where you over charged me, sterling price instead of the euro price! I was never told that shipping from the uk there would be duties. when I was placing the order via the Euro/uk shite, I wasn't told Ireland had to pay duties. That was just 2 problems 1) being over charged to much money. over 100E to much is a lot of much, the dress was 270euor and you incorrectly charged me 250sterling, but difference.I can send you a screen shot of the price I if you want. 2) Duties ''I wouldn't mind paying if I knew from the start I had to. Moving on to trying to communicate with you. 3) I email and everyday someone else would tell me a very short answer, and never give me a full answer. 4) finally I got a email that was the worst ever, ''Your order is cancelled as the dress is not in STOCK'' after a 8 days of your keeping my 400euro. I am really sorry but this is just the worst service I have ever seen. You are definitely having international issues. I love your product. but how can you treat people like this after me spending time and giving you 400euro. I asked someone to call me to explain a few days ago. And they didn't even return my email. I am not just unhappy, I am mad at how you have treated me. I sent at least 8 emails most of them not even replies back, and if they were that were from people that seamed like them didn't really care. What do you have to say to all that??

<1,-1>	I had bought several cloths on June 20th. Roday I went to return some of them and they refused it. Store manager said today is after 30 days and she didnt accept to return or even exchange them. This is THE MOST REDICOLOUS POLICY I'VE HEARD. It doesnt make sence that you count both the day that I bought and the day that I return and say its over 30 days. I bought them on June 20th and made sure to return them on 20th. Even if its past for one day, MANAGER CAN NOT GIVE ME A STORE CREDIT? THIS IS THE WORSTE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RETURN POLICY I'VE EVER SEEN. IN THIS I WOULD NEVER SET FOOT IN A ZARA STORE EVER.
