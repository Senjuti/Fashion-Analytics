<1,-1>	I am really disappointed in your customer service. I ordered some pants and wore them once only to discover the seam on the right leg twists. I called your customer service line and was told to send them back, the pants would be "reviewed" and then I would "possibly" get an exchange. In the mean time I have to go without the pants I ordered. The option I was given was to buy the pants again. Or I was told I could wait a few days while "upper management" was contacted to see if the discount I had used could be reapplied to the pants I bought. I have already ordered the pants twice. I bought them on a Monday and on Wednesday received an email for 30% off. I called and asked if you could do a price adjustment since it was two days later. I was told no. So I bought the pants again at the discount and was going to send back the first pair. Why can't you empower your associates to help customers in the moment? I have always bought your pants from Nordstrom or Piperlime who have much better return policies and customer service. This is INCREDIBLY poor customer service.

<1,-1>	I had purchased a top from Zara. I wanted to get it exchanged. Unfortunately I misplaced the bill. I was asked by the store manager to drop a mail with details to the customer care to get an “Approval‿ for this exchange. They said that I will receive a response within 48 hrs. From Friday 10-Jul-15 till date no one has responded to me. I followed up on the email, no response there, and then I called up the customer care office too and got no definite answer. This service is highly disappointing and not expected from a brand this big. Date of purchase: 5-Jul-15 Location of the store: Phoenix market city, Bangalore Mail sent to Customer care on: 10-Jul-15 Followed up on 13-Jul-15 Called the customer care office (0124 4973500) on 14-Jul-15 And today 15-Jul-15 I have heard absolutely nothing from anyone. I hope someone cares enough and would respond to me at least now.

<1,-1>	ordering in your store, I thought I will get only positive emotions. at the stage of ordering it was, but initially for the order I paid more money. after receiving the order, two pairs of three I did not match in size. the deadline I sent the shoes back and wrote of this support. the store received the parcel on 15 June, and promised to return dengel 3-5 working days. but not returned. my emails store does not respond for 10 days. money I will not return, and it is 160$. it so happened that in the midst of the season I was left without summer shoes and no money to buy it elsewhere. at the moment in the us discounts, but I can not buy anything, because I don't have the money for it. very hurtful situation, the store would not comment on its actions. I will address the issue differently and turn in all possible instances, and also in court.

<1,-1>	Dear H & M I would like to draw your attention to the kind of service (or rather lack threof) I received at your store on the Istiklal street in Istanbul which I visited on 24.07.2015 (evening) while I was on a vacation there. I visited the said store with a friend. I picked up a pair of boxers which were on sale and were now for 10 Turkish Liras, while my friend picked up a pair of sunglasses and a similar pair of boxers. While waiting in the line we thought we would get the billing done separately so we lined up at the cash counter with my friend ahead of me. Once my friend got his billing done and I approached the counter to get my billing done, a man (a local) came and barged into the line and spoke to the girl at the cash counter in their local language(possibly Turkish). They both exchanged a giggle and the man conveniently handed his stuff to the girl at the counter to get his billing done. When I object to this, the girl across the counter, whilst ignoring my objection, kept billing his goods. In spite of being irritated by such behaviour, I decided to not say anything further and simply get my billing done. After getting the billing done, when me and my friend were leaving the store we were behind the same local man. When we reached the store exit, the said local man exited while the sirens started ringing when we came near the door. Embarrassingly, we checked our packets. Upon checking, we found that the girl at the counter had not removed the electric tags from the merchandise we had bought. I volunteered to go back and get them removed while my friend waited outside. Now, as I went back and requested the girl to remove the tags she ignored my request and kept billing. By now I was quite annoyed and I believe the other girl (cashier) at the counter saw that and told the first one to attend to me after which she finally did remove the tags. However, as soon as I came out and checked with my friend, I realised that the product I bought was supposed to be on sale and the cashier had billed it for 25 liras (actual price ) instead of 10 liras (sale price) . I had paid 50 Liras and I was supposed to get back 40 Liras as the boxers were on sale whereas i only got back 25 Liras. Visibly annoyed, I went back to the counter and requested the girl to give me the actual balance. To my utter disgust she again ignored my request and kept at whatever she was doing whilst other customers watch on. The second cashier girl, upon noticing the ignorant attitude being meted out to me by the first cashier called me at her counter and finally gave me my balance back. I have a copy of the said bill/receipt with me. As a regular H & M customer, I have been to your stores in Dubai, London and USA. However, I have not received such racially discriminating and annoying treatment anywhere. I do hope that you look into this seriously and take the said person to task to avoid tarnishing your image.

<0,null>	Good evening guys! Sometimes in life we need to take a step back and reflect on things, reflect on ways and directions we want our lives to take, meditate on the importance of things and then let that reflect positively on the outside through our actions. Right, enough of that. There was a bit of colour blocking going on my end last Sunday and here is what I wore. Skirt ~ Marks & Spencer (Limited edition) Top ~ Matalan (old) Shoes ~ ZARA I must admit that I found these sandals quite comfortable and you won't catch me saying that often about most zara shoes. Have a lovely evening guys, talk to you soon xx

<1,-1>	Kind Attn.: Customer Care Manager, Zara Dear Sir I have had a very poor incident where Zara Jaipur has vanished 4 denims/trousers purchased from them. After over 2 months of regularly following up with them, they say they cannot do anything about it. Following is the chain of events: a) On 3 Jan 2015, I purchased One Denims & One black trousers from Zara Jaipur. Copy of bill attached. b) On 11 Jan 2015, I purchased TWO Trousers (with belt ones). Unfortunately I do not have the bill. Time of purchase was between 1:30 pm and 2:30 pm. On same day I asked for Alteration service of these FOUR pants at Zara Jaipur counter. I was told that Sale is going on, so we cannot do alteration during sale. And they asked me to come after 14 Jan 2015. c) On 17 Jan 2015, I came to Zara Store again with all FOUR pants for alteration. I came in between 5:30 to 7pm. At Alteration counter, the sales person asked me to fill my contact details on one receipt which I did. Then he said he needs to make 4 receipts for 4 pants, and this will take some time (As there was lot of rush). I went around the store with my family for other shopping. Then I went after 15 mins again, but still he said it will take more time to make 4 receipts and asked me to come after 15 more mins. d) Eventually I had an emergency for which I had to rush at some place, and since I was short on time, I could not go back to Zara for collecting receipts. e) On 22 Jan 2015, I came asking for my FOUR pants, and they said they dont know anything about it!! They may have gone back to the shelves. How can they put back pants which are already sold back to the shelves???? f) On every visit of mine to Zara Jaipur, they kept telling me they are checking, half of the times the one or the other manager was not there. I am tired of following up. I have paid over Rs 10 thousand for these FOUR pants which I don't even have. I expect a solution for a reputed brand like ZARA. Either give me my pants or refund me the money. Regards Shivam Talwar +91-9929444222

<1,-1>	Zara is quite a known brand but there are now quality issues. This is regarding leggings that i bought last month. After wearing it 2 times and then a wash made it so loose that i it slips down. Also the fitting because of which zara is trusted for has gone loose from knees which looks so bad. If this is the condition & quality of zara that after spending so much money i am getting this then it totally waste of my money. After wash (in normal temperature water) it looks like its so old as its fitting has gone, loose from waist, bulging knees. I sent an email regarding my problem but there isnt any reply yet. Hope to see an email in my inbox soon.
