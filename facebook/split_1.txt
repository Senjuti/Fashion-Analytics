Very disgusting business.. now we are losing interest in you and will shift our focus on other better brand with better material quality along design than you.

<1,0>	Hi Team, I have bought a levis jeans from your South ex (New Delhi) levis outlet with a name "West Wind Retails". I am highly disappointed with the quality of your jeans, this has never happened with me before and i am using your product since past 10-12 years. The jeans is getting worn out from thigh region within couple of hours of wearing it. It’s been just a week since purchased and have only wore once. I went to the outlet but their response has not been positive, i am not happy with the product and want replacement for the same. Details of the product: Bill Number: 10069 Customer complaint number from the outlet: 3485 Product Code from the bill: BNGWB- The Legging Ab Please revert

<1,-1>	Hi! I'm hoping that I can get some help. About a month ago, I bought the Intimately Free Lila Maxi in preparation for my birthday (which was a few days ago). I always buy a special FP dress for my special day, it's one of my favorite traditions! Something that has been done for many years now. So, on my birthday a few days ago, I got the dress out to wear it for the first time--and, within three hours, the lace on the side was torn! It's a somewhat large tear that is noticeable. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary that may cause a tear, and can't think of what could have caused it. Slightly devastating to have a $98 dress tear within the first few hours of being worn, especially on my birthday! If I go to my local FP store, would there be any way I could exchange it for a new, untorn dress?

<1,-1>	I wear only Levi's denims... So I decided to gift myself Levi's this Diwali. We purchased clothing worth 8K plus from Levi's, Viviana mall... I totally forgot about my Levi's Loop card and cashier at the store never bothered asking for it. When I went for some alteration work after 2 weeks I suddenly remembered that I have a Levi's Loop membership. I requested the store manager to add my 8K purchase points to my loop card and he said it cannot be done now as billing system is online... That was the dumbest excuse given by someone. Guys at Hypercity also add points later if you don't carry the card and don't recollect your membership number. Is only customer responsible to get these points added? There is no responsibility on cashier's part? On top of that they simply forgot to alter my jeans. When I went to collect it, they gave reasons like machine wasn't working etc. They had my number but did not bother informing me about it. Didn't expect such a thing from Levi's... Totally disappointed...
